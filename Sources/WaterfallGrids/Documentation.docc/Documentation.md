# ``WaterfallGrids``

Waterfall grid layout with lazy loading support for SwiftUI

## Overview

WaterfallGrids is a SwiftUI library that allows you to create a waterfall grid layout with lazy loading support. It's similar to the `LazyVGrid` or `Grid` but with a waterfall layout.

It's built on top of `VStack` and `HStack` for eager view, `LazyVStack` and `LazyHStack` for lazy loading, allowing to use all SwiftUI system modifiers and animations.
